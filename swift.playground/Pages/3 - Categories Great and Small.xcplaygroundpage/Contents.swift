//: ## Chapter 3: Categories Great and Small
//: ___
//: ### 1. Generate a free category from:
//: a) A graph with one node and no edges

//: b) A graph with one node and one (directed) edge (hint: this edge can be composed with itself)

//: c) A graph with two nodes and a single arrow between them

//: d) A graph with a single node and 26 arrows marked with the letters of the alphabet: a, b, c â€¦ z.

//: ___
//:### 2. What kind of order is this?
//: a) A set of sets with the inclusion relation: A is included in B if every element of A is also an element of B.

//: b) C++ types with the following subtyping relation: T1 is a subtype of T2 if a pointer to T1 can be passed to a function that expects a pointer to T2 without triggering a compilation error.


//: ___
//:### 3. Considering that Bool is a set of two values True and False, show that it forms two (set-theoretical) monoids with respect to, respectively, operator && (AND) and || (OR).

//: ___
//:### 4. Represent the Bool monoid with the AND operator as a category: List the morphisms and their rules of composition.

//: ___
//:### 5. Represent addition modulo 3 as a monoid category.
